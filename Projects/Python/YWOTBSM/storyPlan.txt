- The attacker rounds a corner. As you do, you found they've disappeared into a crowd. The sudden noise of the street is startling and you realise just how quiet it had been a few moments earlier.

18 Turn around (you) [a you bridge]
- Curiosity overcomes you and go back down that quite street. After turning the corner you can't hear any of the noise from the busy road you just left. Very odd. Maybe poking your nose into odd things isn't the best idea? + You continue to walk and pass through familiar roads, though you have no idea where you are. Trying to look too closely at the signs and buildings starts to give you a headache. You're lost, but you can find your way given enough time.

31 You don't need it [a voice ENDING]

	- 136 Take map (you)

68 Ask for directions (you)
- Doing your best to ignore the oddness of the situation, you ask it how to get to the shop from here. It doesn't say a word, but raises a hand to point down the street. It doesn't lower it's hand until you start to moving in the direction it pointed you in. + You keep walking for a while. And keep walking. You're still walking. + As you begin to wonder how far this street goes, you come upon the shop.

	- 142 Give up and make your own way (voice) [go to 139]

135 Refuse map (voice)

	- 272 Take map (you) [go to 136]

136 Take map (you)
- Your hand shakes as you accept it. You know this is wrong, but you accept it anyway. You thank the thing, your voice no more than a whisper, before you move away to unfold it. It's a map of the local area. A route has been marked out in black pen, with what appears to be a destination, circled in red. Looking at it more closely, you see that the path begins from this very spot. It ends at the shop.

139 Follow your gut and keep walking (voice) [ENDING voice]

141 Call out again (you)
- You call again, your voice sounding just as muted as before. This time though, you see a person walking towards you. It looks like they heard you. + The stranger stops only a meter away and gestures for you to follow. You don't feel like it's safe to refuse its help.

	- 280 Run. (voice) [go to 271]

271 Run (voice) [ENDING voice]
- Giving you the chance to choose was a mistake. You run. But now it will be fine. And run. I'll make sure of it. You don't stop until you end up at the steps to your house. And even then you only pause to take your keys out. Once inside, you quickly lock the door behind you. Your movements don't seem like your own. That doesn't matter, though. We're safe and together. That's all that matters.

274 Follow the route (you)

	- 54 Talk about the weather

53 How are they?
- They frown, but as the silence continues they manage a reply. + "I'm alright." + It sounds more like "Leave me alone." You consider talking about the weather. It's a bad idea.

	- 107 Leave them alone
	- 108 Continue the suffering [go to 54]

54 Weather's looking good, right?

216 Window shopping time!
- Deciding that you have time to kill, you keep on walking past the item you came for. You have no money for anything else, but you want to look around anyway.

	- 433 Buy something else
	- 434 Buy milk
