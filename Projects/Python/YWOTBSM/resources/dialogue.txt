0 | - You need to go out to by some milk. But things are never so easy. On the way, you + witness an assult. It happens in broad daylight, but you are the only one around. Do + you... +  + 1. Help out + 2. Leave | 1 | 2
1 | - You approach the people as they scuffle, though you are hesitant. You want to + help, you really do, but something feels off. Pushing the feeling away you go to + break the fight up.

2 | - You continue walking, pretending you don't see. You feel so much safer already, + leaving that man to his fate. You're at the shop now. Will you do what you came for? +  + 1. No. Wander around a bit + 2. Sure. Go look for the milk | 5 | 6
3 | - As they run, you follow. They are pretty fast, but you don't have much trouble + keeping up. What worries you, though, are all the twists and turns they're + taking. You know the area well, so you won't get lost. But still... the way + they're going doesn't quite sit right with you. You should ignore that feeling. What now? +  + 1. Give up the chase + 2. Keep going | 7 | 8
4 | - As you watch the man leave, you feel uneasy. You feel the urge to follow them. + After checking that the person is okay, you remember that you were supposed to be + buying milk. That doesn't seem so important anymore. The man that ran though... +  + 1. Chase the man + 2. Go buy the milk | 3 | 10
5 | - You're at a shop with just enough money to buy milk, but you decided to look + around. There's nothing that catches your interest. The cashier is giving you a + weird look. +  + 1. Look for milk + 2. Talk to them | 6 | 12
6 | - You go to the section with the milk and buy it. Now that you've got the milk, + you can finally enjoy a nice breakfast. Well done for not messing things up. +  + 1. You have reached the "Breakfast" ending + 2. Enter 1 or 2 to continue | -1 | -1

8 | - The attacker rounds a corner. As you do, you found they've disappeared into a + crowd. The sudden noise of the street is startling and you realise just how quiet + it had been a few moments earlier. At that thought, you feel as though you're + being watched. Ignore the feeling. Just go and buy the milk. +  + 1. Buy milk + 2. Turn around | 17 | 18
10 | - After wishing that person well, you finally return to your initial objective. + It's a little late for that, but you're determined. The streets are still empty, + you notice. Is it always like this at - you check your watch - 09:17? You don't + think so... +  + 1. Ignore the feeling... + 2. ... and keep going | 15 | 15
12 | - You say 'hi' and they quickly look away. Maybe you should take the hint? +  + 1. Just buy the milk + 2. Talk again | 6 | 26
15 | - You make your way to the shop. It's awfully quiet. You know, going home might be a good idea. +  + 1. Going home does sound good + 2. But breakfast though... | 31 | 32
16 | - Changing your mind, you make to follow person, but you've lost them completely. + And now you're lost! You wander the streets, trying to find your barings. + Everything feels familiar, as it should, but you still feel lost. It's like being + in a dream.

17 | - You continue down the noisy street and make your way to the shop. You buy the + milk and return home with no further disruptions. Finally. +  + 1. You have reached the "Alternate Breakfast" ending + 2. Enter 1 or 2 to continue | -1 | -1
18 | - Curiosity overcomes you and go back down that quite street. After turning the + corner you can't hear any of the noise from the busy road you just left. + Very odd. Maybe poking your nose into odd things isn't the best idea? + You continue to walk and pass through familiar roads, though you have no idea where you are. + Trying to look too closely at the signs and buildings starts to give you a + headache. You're lost, but you can find your way given enough time. + Just don't... interact with anything. + Not even that person by the bus stop in the distance. +  + 1. Interact with person + 2. Ignore the person | 33 | 34
26 | - Throwing reason out of the window, you decide to talk to this person who's + clearly not in the mood for conversation. +  + 1. Ask them how they're doing + 2. Talk about the weather | 53 | 54
31 | - A sensible choice. You go straight back home, not letting any of life's + destractions get to you. When you close the front door behind you, you notice + your hands are shaking. It's nothing to worry about. We're safe now. +  + 1. "Let's hope it stays that way" + 2. Enter 1 or 2 to continue | -1 | -1
32 | - You ignore common sense and continue on towards the shop. The journey is taking + a lot longer than usual... Are you lost?

Keep on walking | 33 | 34
33 | - You... you walk right up to them, completely oblivious to all the warnings. The + thing turns as you near it. An expression of mild surprise crosses its... your face? + It has your face. +  + 1. Check your reflection + 2. Ask for directions | 67 | 68
34 | - As you pass you can feel their eyes on you. You keep walking and the unease + fades as they get further away. You still have no idea where you are. It's still + too quiet. +  + 1. Check phone for directions + 2. Call out for someone | 69 | 70
53 | - They frown, but as the silence continues they manage a reply. + "I'm alright." + It sounds more like "Leave me alone." You consider talking about the weather. It's a bad idea. +  + 1. Leave them alone + 2. Continue the suffering | 107 | 54
54 | - You can almost see them die inside as the words leave your mouth. They are + likely wondering what they did to deserve this cursed existance. +  + 1. Keep the 'convo' going + 2. Leave them in peace | 109 | 107
67 | - Confused, you look at the glass of the shelter. Your face stares back at you. + The stranger with your face seems amused. It grins and offers you a paper map. +  + 1. Refuse the map + 2. Take the map | 135 | 136
68 | - Doing your best to ignore the oddness of the situation, you ask it how to get + to the shop from here. It doesn't say a word, but raises a hand to point down the + street. It doesn't lower it's hand until you start to moving in the direction it + pointed you in. You keep walking for a while. And keep walking. You're still + walking. As you begin to wonder how far this street goes, you come upon the + shop. You get the feeling that this isn't where it's supposed to be as you look + at the surrounding buildings. Every one is residential. They all look like your + house. +  + 1. Go to the shop + 2. Examine the houses | 137 | 138
69 | - The phone has no signal. +  + 1. Follow your gut. Keep walking + 2. Call out for someone | 139 | 70
70 | - No one answers. The air seems to swallow up your call. You get the feeling that + no one more than a couple of meters away would have heard that. +  + 1. Call out again + 2. Give up. Make you own way instead | 141 | 139
107 | - Remembering that you're here to buy milk and not harass the shop assistant, you + leave them to find the dairy aisle. Once there, you spot the milk. +  + 1. Buy the milk + 2. Browse the shop | 215 | 216

135 | - Your skin prickles at the thought of taking the map from the thing and you take + a step backwards. It keeps its hand outstretched, still holding the map out to + you, but the smile is gone. +  + 1. Run. + 2. Take map | 271 | 136
136 | - Your hand shakes as you accept it. You know this is wrong, but you accept it + anyway. You thank the thing, your voice no more than a whisper, before you move + away to unfold it. It's a map of the local area. A route has been marked out in + black pen, with what appears to be a destination, circled in red. Looking at it + more closely, you see that the path begins from this very spot. It ends at the + shop. +  + 1. Find your way home + 2. Follow the route | 139 | 274

216 | - Deciding that you have time to kill, you keep on walking past the item you came + for.

271 | - Giving you the chance to choose was a mistake. You run. But now it will be + fine. And run. I'll make sure of it. You don't stop until you end up at the steps + to your house. And even then you only pause to take your keys out. Once inside, + you quickly lock the door behind you. Your movements don't seem like your own. + That doesn't matter, though.
